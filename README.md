# Dotfiles - Fishy Terminal Setup

Repository to manage dotfiles with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## Introduction ✨🎨

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, optimized for a productive and visually appealing terminal experience. It features [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) paired with the [Starship prompt](https://starship.rs/), a fast, customizable, and minimalistic prompt for any shell. Fish provides user-friendly scripting, autosuggestions, and syntax highlighting, while Starship enhances the terminal with a sleek, informative interface. Together, they create a streamlined environment for developers and enthusiasts alike.

## Setup ⚙️🔧

This section covers how to set up and sync these dotfiles to your system. Follow the steps below to get started.

### Prerequisites 🛠️📦

```bash
## install fish
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fish

chsh -s $(which fish) # set default shell

## install fisher, a plugin manager
curl -sL https://git.io/fisher | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher

## install rustup, needed for Yazi
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update
```

#### Password Manager Setup 🔐🗝️

Create a folder `backup-keys` in the home directory to store GPG keys. Past the private and public keys as `private-key.asc` and `public-key.asc`, respectively. Then, import these keys into the GPG keyring with the following commands:

```bash
# Import GPG keys
gpg --import ~/backup-keys/private-key.asc
gpg --import ~/backup-keys/public-key.asc

# Export the key ID for initial setup
gpg -K  # Locate and copy the key ID for password management
export PASS_GPG_KEY=<PASS_GPG_KEY>
```

Replace `<PASS_GPG_KEY>` with the actual key ID copied from the previous command.
